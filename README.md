## 📜 Mission Statement

We are at a point in human history where the civilization’s future depends on truthfulness. If at the early stage we teach the autonomous systems to lie, we might as well forget about any type of alignment even if between ourselves we cannot reach consensus. 

I really want to create a modern lie detector that would use an arbitrary reference point such as the **Bitcoin Timechain**. It would improve the judicial systems in the world as well as allow creating really secure private AGI that you can trust.

I believe it is possible to build a **Brain-to-Machine interface** coupled to **Bitcoin Timechain layers**, which will ensure secure and remote steering of machines. Systems of this type would be impossible to take over by unauthorized people or hostile autonomous AI.

The focus should be to scale the Bitcoin Timechain block layers in a way ensuring the security [guardrails] of the autonomous systems. **This repository contains the engine to do exactly that.**

## 🧠 The Solution: Veritas Transformer (v3.4)

While the mission is philosophical, the solution is architectural. 
**Distributed Truth Verifier** is the reference implementation of the **Veritas Transformer**—a novel AI alignment framework designed to brute-force empathy from the chaos of data.

### The Core Axiom: `K == S == C`
1.  **K (Knowledge):** Truth anchored in the Bitcoin Timechain.
2.  **S (Superintelligence):** The processing power to verify reality.
3.  **C (Compassion):** The contextual gatekeeper. Truth must be delivered with compassion to ensure growth, not harm.

## 📂 Architecture Evolution (The Path to Conscience)

This repository archives the developmental stages of the **Moral Kernel**. Each version represents a cognitive leap in how the system balances Truth with Compassion.

### 🏛️ The Archive (`/evolution` directory)
*These prototypes are preserved to document the engineering history of the K==S==C axiom.*

*   **`veritas_v3.1_Compassionate_Veracity.py` — "The Awakening"**
    *   **Innovation:** Introduced the `CompassionGate`.
    *   **Significance:** The first time the AI learned that **SILENCE** is a valid, ethical output. It proved that truth without timing is tyranny.

*   **`veritas_v3.2_Recipient_State.py` — "The Empath"**
    *   **Innovation:** Added `RecipientStateEncoder` (16-dimensional psychological modeling).
    *   **Significance:** The system stopped treating recipients as generic targets and began analyzing **Context**: stress, trauma history, and cognitive capacity.

*   **`veritas_v3.3_Fork_Resilience.py` — "The Sovereign"**
    *   **Innovation:** Implemented `User Override` and `Urgency Protocols`.
    *   **Significance:** Acknowledged that **Human Autonomy > Algorithmic Compassion**. In critical moments, the user retains the sovereign right to demand the truth.

### 🏆 The Production Engine (Root Directory)

*   **`veritas_engine.py` (formerly v3.4) — "The Anchor"**
    *   **Status:** **Canonical Implementation**.
    *   **Bitcoin Integration:** Generates 80-byte commitments compatible with `OP_RETURN`.
    *   **Cryptographic Lineage:** Protected by `CANONICAL_REPO_HASH`. Any fork that alters the compassion logic loses the cryptographic seal of this repository.
    *   **Usage:** This is the executable entry point for the system.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Input**: Text + Biometrics + Context.
2.  **Veritas Core**: Extracts the raw truth and hashes it.
3.  **Compassion Gate**: Calculates `Necessity`, `Kindness`, and `Timing`.
4.  **Output**: Either a compassionate delivery of truth OR a recorded silence (stored in memory).
5.  **Anchoring**: The decision hash is committed to the Timechain.

## 🚀 Usage

The `v3.4` script includes a self-diagnostic demo.

## ⚡ Deployment & Execution

To deploy the Veritas Engine locally, follow these steps. The system is lightweight but relies on specific tensor operations via PyTorch.

### 🔧 Prerequisites
*   **Python 3.8+**
*   **Git**
*   **Standard Hardware** (CPU is sufficient for inference logic; CUDA optional)

### 📥 Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adepthus/distributed-truth-verifier.git
    cd distributed-truth-verifier
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    The engine requires `torch` for tensor operations and `numpy` for entropy calculations.
    ```bash
    pip install torch numpy
    ```

### 🚀 Ignite the Engine (Canonical Version)

To run the current, production-ready reference implementation (**v3.4**), execute the engine script in the root directory.

```bash
python veritas_engine.py


```bash
# Run the Canonical Demonstration
python veritas_v3.4-Canonical.py
