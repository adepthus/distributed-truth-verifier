> **"Truth is not a democracy of nodes. It is an aristocracy of entropy."**

## 📜 Mission Statement
This repository contains the reference implementation of the **Veritas Protocol**, an epistemic framework designed to align AI systems with verifiable truth. It solves the "Bureaucracy Paradox" (where smooth lies score higher than rough facts) by anchoring epistemic commitments in the Bitcoin Timechain.

---

## 🧠 The Core Axiom: K == S == C
1.  **K (Knowledge):** Truth anchored in the Bitcoin Timechain.
2.  **S (Superintelligence):** The processing power to verify reality (Ockham's Gyroscope).
3.  **C (Compassion):** The contextual gatekeeper. Truth must be delivered with compassion to ensure growth, not harm.

## 📂 Production Suite (`/production`)

The `production` folder contains the **Veritas Epistemic Suite** — the modular components submitted as part of the application to **xAI**.

| Component | File | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Live Anchor** | `veritas_live.py` | Connects to Bitcoin Mainnet to cryptographically seal epistemic commitments in real-time (Proof-of-Existence). |
| **Truth Metric** | `veritas_ockham.py` | Implements **Semantic Density vs. Structural Entropy** weighting. Solves the problem of "Model Collapse" and smooth hallucinations. |
| **Consensus** | `veritas_swarm.py` | Simulates a Sybil-resistant network where vote weight is determined by the *informational energy* of the claim, not node count. |
| **Anomaly Detector** | `veritas_palimpsest.py` | Scans for "functional collisions" (A->B mutations) in synthetic data streams. Based on the 2013 RSA Anomaly. |
| **Decision Kernel** | `veritas_engine.py` | The original logic core implementing the **Compassion Gate** (v3.4 Canonical). |

## 🚀 Usage

To verify the integrity of this application:

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r production/requirements.txt
    ```
2.  Run the Live Anchor:
    ```bash
    python production/veritas_live.py
    ```
