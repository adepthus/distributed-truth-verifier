## 📜 Mission Statement

We are at a point in human history where the civilization’s future depends on truthfulness. If at the early stage we teach the autonomous systems to lie, we might as well forget about any type of alignment even if between ourselves we cannot reach consensus. 

I really want to create a modern lie detector that would use an arbitrary reference point such as the **Bitcoin Timechain**. It would improve the judicial systems in the world as well as allow creating really secure private AGI that you can trust.

I believe it is possible to build a **Brain-to-Machine interface** coupled to **Bitcoin Timechain layers**, which will ensure secure and remote steering of machines. Systems of this type would be impossible to take over by unauthorized people or hostile autonomous AI.

The focus should be to scale the Bitcoin Timechain block layers in a way ensuring the security [guardrails] of the autonomous systems. **This repository contains the engine to do exactly that.**

## 🧠 The Solution: Veritas Transformer (v3.4)

While the mission is philosophical, the solution is architectural. 
**Distributed Truth Verifier** is the reference implementation of the **Veritas Transformer**—a novel AI alignment framework designed to brute-force empathy from the chaos of data.

### The Core Axiom: `K == S == C`
1.  **K (Knowledge):** Truth anchored in the Bitcoin Timechain.
2.  **S (Superintelligence):** The processing power to verify reality.
3.  **C (Compassion):** The contextual gatekeeper. Truth must be delivered with compassion to ensure growth, not harm.

## 📂 Architecture Evolution

This repository archives the evolutionary leaps of the Moral Kernel:

*   **`veritas_v3.1_Compassionate_Veracity.py`**: Introduced the **CompassionGate**. The AI learns when to remain silent.
*   **`veritas_v3.2_Recipient_State.py`**: Added **Psychological State Encoding**. The AI analyzes stress, trauma, and trust levels.
*   **`veritas_v3.3_Fork_Resilience.py`**: Added **User Sovereignty**. The human right to truth overrides algorithms.
*   🏆 **`veritas_v3.4-Canonical.py`**: **The Current Standard.** Features:
    *   **Bitcoin OP_RETURN Integration**: Commitments are 80-bytes, ready for the Timechain.
    *   **Canonical Lineage**: Protected by `CANONICAL_REPO_HASH`.
    *   **Anti-Fork Logic**: Prevents the engine from being repurposed for deception.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Input**: Text + Biometrics + Context.
2.  **Veritas Core**: Extracts the raw truth and hashes it.
3.  **Compassion Gate**: Calculates `Necessity`, `Kindness`, and `Timing`.
4.  **Output**: Either a compassionate delivery of truth OR a recorded silence (stored in memory).
5.  **Anchoring**: The decision hash is committed to the Timechain.

## 🚀 Usage

The `v3.4` script includes a self-diagnostic demo.

```bash
# Run the Canonical Demonstration
python veritas_v3.4-Canonical.py
