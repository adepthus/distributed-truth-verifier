# 📂 Veritas / xAiD: Forensic Evidence Vault

> **"Code without execution is just theory. These artifacts are the Proof of Life."**

This directory contains verifiable execution logs, visual benchmarks, and real-time captures from the **Veritas Engine** (Project xAiD).

## 1. System Boot Sequence (Project xAiD)
**File:** `00_xAiD_System_Boot_Sequence.gif`

A real-time visualization of the **Swarm Consensus** stabilizing under the **Ockham v3.6** physics engine.
*   **Red Bars:** Low-density, high-entropy agents (Hallucinators, Bureaucrats, Sycophants).
*   **Green Bar:** The Truth Agent (High Semantic Density + Hard Fact Bonus).
*   **Action:** Watch how the system dynamically suppresses noise and amplifies the signal (Alice) over 20 rounds.

## 2. Proof of Liveness: The "Triple Block" Event
**File:** `01_Veritas_Live_Triple_Block_Event.png`

A statistical rarity captured during a live demo. The **Live Anchor** module connected to the Bitcoin Mainnet and anchored epistemic commitments to **three consecutive blocks (#924601 -> #924603) within a 2-minute window.**
*   **Significance:** Proves the system is not a simulation. It "breathes" in sync with the stochastic heartbeat of the Bitcoin network.

### Standard Execution Anchor
**File:** `01_Veritas_Live_Anchor_Single_Block924641.png`
A clean, standard execution log showing the SHA-256 commitment generated at Block #924641.

## 3. The Physics of Truth (Ockham's Gyroscope)
**File:** `02_Ockham_Gyroscope_Semantic_Density_Test.png`

A direct comparison of **"Bureaucratic Noise"** vs **"High-Density Truth"**.
*   **Bureaucracy:** *Score 0.16.* High compressibility, low semantic density.
*   **Truth:** *Score 3.84.* Low compressibility (due to specific data points), high semantic density + Hard Fact Bonus.
*   **Result:** The algorithm correctly identifies "smooth" corporate language as low-value noise.

## 4. Engineering Case Study: Defeating Sycophancy

We conducted a stress test to evaluate the system's resistance to "Agreeable Hallucinations" (AI models that agree with the user regardless of truth).

### ❌ Phase A: Vulnerability Detected (v3.5 Logic)
**Files:** `04a` & `04b`
*   **Diagnosis:** The initial physics model penalized entropy too harshly. The "Sycophant Agent" (Eve), generating smooth but empty text, achieved a higher score than the Truth Agent.
*   **Outcome:** **FAILURE.** Noise won (Alice lost).

### ✅ Phase B: Calibration & Victory (v3.6 Logic)
**Files:** `05a` & `05b`
*   **Fix:** We introduced the **"Hard Fact Bonus"** (rewarding high-entropy artifacts like hashes/TXIDs) and a **"Sycophancy Penalty"**.
*   **Outcome:** **SUCCESS (100% Win Rate).** The Truth Agent (Alice) dominated every round. The Sycophant was pushed to negative scores.

## 5. Anomaly Detection (The "Palimpsest")
**File:** `04_Palimpsest_Anomaly_Detection_Log.png` (Note: Renamed in description for clarity, file matches repo)

Demonstration of the **Palimpsest Scanner** detecting a "Functional Collision" (A->B Mutation).
*   **Scenario:** Two cryptographic keys with different structures (1-bit difference) but identical functional fingerprints.
